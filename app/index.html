                <p>
                  I was born on August 7th, 1996 in Toronto, Ontario. Afterwards, I moved to Pomona Village, NY, but my family moved around for a bit until we settled down in Lawrenceville, New Jersey, where I spent nine years of my life. I attended Lawrence High School. I am now at Duke University and I plan to be a software engineer, and eventually complete a Ph.D in signals processing.

                    <li><b>STEM Club</b> - President.

                Reading has been my favorite pastime for as long as I can remember. Books can be an infinite source of wisdom, a way to explore another world, or an exciting story with great characters. I mainly read nonfiction nowadays (big fan of Michael Lewis!) but I'll read just about anything that grips my attention.

                    I plan on attaining a Ph.D after experiencing the workforce for a few years. I am mostly interested in statistical signals processing, with which I have had experience at Duke. I am also interested in machine learning and data mining.

                  <p>
                    KingMaker is a Meteor.js web-app that uses facial recognition to process PayPal and credit card transactions. The computer vision software was written in C and the payments were processed by BrainTree API. For this project, I worked across the stack with an emphasis on front-end and middleware (HTML/CSS/JS). However, I also used my machine learning experience to give input on the computer vision side. This project was created at the Money20/20 Hackathon.

                    Duke Petitions is a centralized petitions platform where Duke students can log on and vote on issues relevant to campus life and academic affairs. This project was commissioned by Duke Student Government and is very close to launch. I worked across the stack on this app and helped a lot with API design. I used HTML/CSS/JS (Handlebars.js)/PHP for this app.

                    For VersaMe Inc, I used MATLAB to create speech activity detection software as the culmination of a summer of research. I implemented a Hidden Markov Model to model speech/nonspeech with each state being represented by a mixture of four Gaussians. In the end, the error rate for this SAD was comparable to that of <a href="http://www-lium.univ-lemans.fr/diarization/doku.php/welcome">LIUM</a> and within 10-15% of <a href="http://shout-toolkit.sourceforge.net/use_case_diarization.html">SHoUT</a> (leading open source speech recognition toolkits).

                  <p>
                    In the summer after freshman year, I created a web-app for Bright Cloud International Corp to allow doctors and patients to log in and view dynamically modeled medical data. In accordance with NIH standards, I built the backend using PHP and MySQL, which stored medical data as well as secure login data. In addition to HTML/CSS/PHP/MySQL, I used to open source library <a href="http://jpgraph.net/">JpGraph</a> to perform many of the modeling operations.

                    Atlas was a Polymer webapp that parses the text of a book and displays on a Google Map the various settings of the book. I worked mainly on backend (FireBase) and middleware. We used the <a href="http://dp.la/info/developers/codex/">DPLA API</a> to obtain book text and OpenCalais to parse the text. This was a project for Codex Hackathon.
